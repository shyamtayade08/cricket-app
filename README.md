# Deploy Cricket Score App using Kubernetes

- Created a Python script to fetch and process live cricket match data from the Cricbuzz API.
* Designed the application to parse, display, and analyze match statistics in real-time.
- Built a Docker container for the Python application, ensuring a consistent environment across deployments.
* Pushed the container image to Google Artifact Registry for scalable and secure storage.
- Configured Google Cloud Build to automatically trigger builds and deploy the container image to the Kubernetes cluster upon updates, ensuring continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).
* Deployed the containerized application on a GKE cluster, ensuring high availability and seamless scaling.
- Utilized Kubernetes for managing container orchestration, with smooth rolling updates and automated scaling.
